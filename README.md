# The issue

> Write a program in Ruby that takes one command line argument (referred to going forward as n).
> If n is not a perfect square print an appropriate error message and exit. If n is a perfect
> square then create a sequence from 1 to  n and build a matrix from the sequence by walking
> in counter-clockwise spiral order. Examples below illustrate this for n=1,4,9,16 but your
> solution should work for any n that is a perfect square. Once you have built the matrix print
> it, ensuring even column widths as in examples below and then exit.
>
>       Input:  1
>       Output: 1
>
>       Input:  4
>       Output: 4 3
>                 1 2
>
>       Input:  9
>       Output: 5 4 3
>               6 1 2
>               7 8 9

>       Input:  16
